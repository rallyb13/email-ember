Welcome to B-mail!
```

It's like electronic mail, but it's all Benjamin's
(and it doesn't go anywhere).
This is an Ember.js website.

Due to asynchronous loading issues, you should use:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

in the console in order to display this site.

Seeing as there is no log in,
this email is currently an everyone-purpose email,
which means you have to enter both the from & the to of each email.
I'm hopeful that this will make for easier sorting...
once I add that functionality.

```
Current issues:
```

While I could totally have you create an email from inside a folder,
I can't currently figure out a way to add the email to folder
after the fact.

The forms don't currently clear out.

I'd eventually like to make the compose button disappear
while the form button is visible. Just haven't gotten to that
with the higher priority stuff in my way.

Oh, and the navbar could be nicer.
